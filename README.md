This project is a modification of the LIGO project. I took the existing LIGO notebook, created a library for the ligo.py file called ligotools to run their code as a package, created an environment.yml file to track dependencies for running the code (with a functioning kernel), and uploaded the completed work to Binder for interactive notebook capabilities.
